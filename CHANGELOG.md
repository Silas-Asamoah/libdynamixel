- [API change] (addition) `auto_detect` `and auto_detect_map` now have an optional (function overload) second argument: a `std::vector` of `Protocol::id_t` (servo ID); if this argument is provided, the library will only scan for the desired IDs
- [Improvement] command line utility uses the above functionality to dramatically reduce response time when IDs are provided.

## Current branch

- [Deprecation] removed method `get_goal_speed_angle` that only duplicated `get_moving_speed` and brought nothing
- [API change] renamed methods `reg_goal_speed_angle` and `set_goal_speed_angle` respectively to `reg_moving_speed_angle` and `set_moving_speed_angle`
- [Improvement] add information on the unit in error message for position and speed limit overflow
