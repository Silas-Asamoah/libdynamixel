libdynamixel
============

libdynamixel is a C++ interface to the dynamixel actuators. Currently, we have library code and an utility that uses it for a few tasks like changing the IDs, the control mode and the baudrate.

This library is used as the main building block for a ROS node that can be found in the [dynamixel_control](https://github.com/jbmouret/dynamixel_control) repository.

The work is in progress, the documentation too.
