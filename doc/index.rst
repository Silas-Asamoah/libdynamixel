Libdynamixel's documentation
============================

libdynamixel
------------
`libdynamixel <https://github.com/resibots/libdynamixel>`__ is a C++ library for the `Dynamixel <http://en.robotis.com/index/product.php?cate_code=101010>`__ actuators. Its goals are to be fast and to work with most Dynamixels, including the Dynamixel Pro actuators.

This library comes with a command line utility that can, among other things, be very convenient for the configuration of your actuators.

Features
--------

* supports Dynamixel series AX, MX, EX, XL and Pro
* supports all instructions and messages of both version 1 and 2 of the Dynamixel communication protocol
* full C++ api

  * template-based API for fast and low-level access
  * class-based unified API abstracting away the differences between the actuators (as long as they use the same Dynamixel protocol).
